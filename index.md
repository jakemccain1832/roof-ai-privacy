Privacy Policy (Roof-AI Maps Proxy)
This service provides an API used by a Custom GPT to retrieve Google Maps data (e.g., geocoding, static maps, street view images, and places search) for user-requested locations.

Data processed

Text the user provides (e.g., addresses, search queries) may be sent to this service.

This service forwards required inputs to Google Maps Platform APIs to fulfill the request.

Data storage

The service does not intentionally store personal data in a database.

Basic operational logs (e.g., timestamps, endpoint called, error codes) may be temporarily retained for debugging and abuse prevention.

Sharing

Requests are sent to Google Maps Platform APIs to generate results.

Security

API keys are stored server-side and are not shared with end users.

The service uses an authentication header to limit access.
